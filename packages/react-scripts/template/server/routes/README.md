# CREATING ROUTES

# Mapping
All routes must be linked inside either map.js or securemap.js, all routes linked in either of these files will be made available automatically through the router.js. Routes inside the securemap will automatically require validation using a pair of values from a valid token. Tokens are given when the user creates an account or logs into the server.
